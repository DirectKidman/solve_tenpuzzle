# Solve ten puzzle

This program is written by Rust.

Since I wrote rust for the first time, this program is so complicated.

If you wanna use this program, please type the below commands.

```
$ cargo run <4-digit number>
```
or 

```
$ cargo run
```

If you designate a number, Expression is appeared.
If else, the number which makes 10 is shown.



......English is too hard :-(
